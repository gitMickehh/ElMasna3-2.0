  PageTitle: Building Floors
  PageDescription: Your floor can have 10 workers, 5 are on machines and 5 are on
    a break. To increase the capacity of your factory, you can build a new floor.
    To build a new floor you have to pay using the yellow coins and press the "build
    new floor" button. The price of building a floor is written on the button as it
    gets more expensive with each new floor.
