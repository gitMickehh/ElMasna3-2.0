  PageTitle: Factory Day Time
  PageDescription: A day in the factory is equal to one hour of a real-life day. Every
    new day, new workers come to your reception building and they leave by the end
    of it. Even if you are not playing the game, the game days pass in real time.
    So make sure to gather your machines revenue every once in a while to gain the
    most profit.
